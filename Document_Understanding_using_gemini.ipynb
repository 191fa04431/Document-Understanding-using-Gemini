It then dives into data structures, including basic types like arrays and linked lists, and progresses to more advanced structures like trees and graphs. Algorithmic complexity, sorting and searching algorithms, graph algorithms, and indexing techniques are also covered. It recommends practicing problem-solving with different techniques (Brute force, backtracking, greedy) and leveraging platforms like Leetcode and Edabit.
